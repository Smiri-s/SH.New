        <p>Oh, she knows what I think about.And what I think about
        One love, two mouths.One love, one house.No shirts, no blouse
        Just us, you find out. Nothing I really wanna tell you about no
        'Cause it's too cold, whoa For you here
        And now, so let me hold, whoa Both your hands in the holes of my sweater.</p> 
        
        <p>And if I may just take your breath away. I don't mind if there's not much to say
        Sometimes the silence guides your mind So move to a place so far away
        The goosebumps start to race The minute that my left hand meets your waist
        And then I watch your face Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste yeah These hearts adore, everyone the other beat heart is for
        Inside this place is warm Outside it starts to pour.</p>
