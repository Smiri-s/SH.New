<h4>Sweater Weather</h4>
<p>“Oh, she knows what I think about</p> 
<p>And what I think about</p>
<p>One love, two mouths</p>
<p>One love, one house</p>
<p>No shirts, no blouse</p>
<p>Just us, you find out</p>
<p>Nothing I really wanna tell you about no</p>
<p>'Cause it's too cold, whoa</p>
<p>For you here</p>
<p>And now, so let me hold, whoa</p>
<p>Both your hands in the holes of my sweater</p>
<p>And if I may just take your breath away</p>
<p>I don't mind if there's not much to say</p>
<p>Sometimes the silence guides your mind</p>
<p>So move to a place so far away</p>
<p>The goosebumps start to race</p>
<p>The minute that my left hand meets your waist</p>
<p>And then I watch your face</p>
<p>Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste yeah</p>
<p>These hearts adore, everyone the other beat heart is for</p>
<p>Inside this place is warm</p>
<p>Outside it starts to pour.”</p>
